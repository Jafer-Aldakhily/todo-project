# Work.it Project

**I created a work it projects, which is a to-do app used to organize tasks, so registered users can divide their tasks, which is helping them to improve their achievements, and enhance their performance.

Now, I would like to tell you how we can use a project in the simplest scenario.
So firstly you need to visit our website and create your account, then you will transfer from home to the app page, which is containing the user profile and many options that allows the user to create your task and give its deadline to complete it, and the user can edit his task or delete at and he can filter his tasks depending on 
the tasks priorities, which is dividing into three types critical for necessary tasks, and normal for a normal task, and low-priority for an unimportant task.
Finally, our app has a drag and drop feature for the tasks and the user can delete all completed tasks.**
